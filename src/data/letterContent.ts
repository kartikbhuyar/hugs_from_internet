  `Dear Teju,

I know today feels heavy, and the world seems a little darker than usual. But I want you to know that it's okay to feel sad sometimes. Your feelings are valid, and you don't have to carry this weight alone.

Remember that storms don't last forever, and neither will this sadness. You are stronger than you know, braver than you feel, and more loved than you can imagine. I'm here for you, always.

Take your time to heal, be gentle with yourself, and know that brighter days are coming. You mean the world to me, and I believe in you completely.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I can feel your heart hurting from here, and I wish I could wrap you in the biggest hug right now. Sadness is like rain - it feels overwhelming when you're in it, but it nourishes growth and brings clarity.

You don't have to be strong all the time. It's okay to cry, to feel lost, to need comfort. That's what makes you beautifully human. Your vulnerability is not weakness; it's courage.

I'm sending you all my love and strength. Lean on me whenever you need to. You're never alone in this journey, and I'll always be your safe harbor in any storm.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Today might feel like the hardest day, but I want to remind you of something important: you've survived 100% of your worst days so far. That's an incredible track record, and it shows just how resilient you are.

Your sadness doesn't define you - your kindness, your strength, your beautiful heart does. This feeling is temporary, but your worth is permanent. You matter more than you know.

I'm here to listen, to comfort, to remind you of your light when you can't see it yourself. You're not just my friend; you're my inspiration.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I see you trying to smile through the pain, and my heart aches for you. You don't have to pretend with me. Let yourself feel everything - the sadness, the confusion, the hurt. It's all part of healing.

You are like a beautiful flower that sometimes needs rain to grow. This sadness is watering the seeds of your strength, compassion, and wisdom. You're becoming even more amazing through this.

Remember, I'm always just a call away. Your happiness matters to me more than anything in this world. We'll get through this together, one day at a time.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When sadness visits you, remember that it's just a visitor - not a permanent resident. You have the power to choose how long it stays and what lessons it teaches you before it leaves.

Your heart is so pure and loving, and sometimes that means it feels things more deeply. That's not a flaw; it's your superpower. The world needs more people who feel as deeply as you do.

I'm grateful every day that you're in my life. Your friendship is a gift I treasure beyond words. Let me be your strength when you feel weak, your hope when you feel lost.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know you're going through a tough time, and I want you to know that it's okay to not be okay. You don't have to have all the answers or fix everything right now. Sometimes, just breathing is enough.

You are so much stronger than you realize. Every challenge you've faced has made you wiser, every tear has made you more compassionate, every struggle has made you more resilient.

I believe in you with every fiber of my being. You're going to come through this even more beautiful than before. I'm here to walk beside you every step of the way.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sadness can feel like a heavy blanket sometimes, but remember that even the darkest night eventually gives way to dawn. Your light hasn't gone out - it's just dimmed for a moment.

You have touched so many lives with your kindness and love. You've been a source of joy and comfort to others, and now it's time to let others, including me, be that for you.

Your worth isn't determined by how you feel today. You are valuable, loved, and irreplaceable just as you are. This sadness will pass, but my love for you is eternal.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I wish I could take away all your pain and carry it myself. Since I can't, I want to carry you through this difficult time with my love, support, and unwavering friendship.

You are not broken, even when you feel shattered. You are not weak, even when you feel powerless. You are not alone, even when you feel isolated. You are loved beyond measure.

Take all the time you need to heal. There's no rush, no timeline for feeling better. I'll be here through every tear, every sleepless night, every moment of doubt. You're stuck with me forever.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sometimes life feels like a puzzle with missing pieces, and today might be one of those days. But remember, you are not incomplete - you are a masterpiece in progress.

Your sadness shows how deeply you care, how much you love, how beautifully human you are. Don't let anyone tell you to "just get over it" or "think positive." Feel what you need to feel.

I'm sending you virtual hugs, warm thoughts, and all the love in my heart. You mean everything to me, and I'll never stop believing in your ability to overcome anything.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Today I want to remind you that it's okay to rest, to pause, to take a break from being strong. Even the mightiest trees bend in the storm - it doesn't make them weak, it makes them wise.

You have been a light in so many people's lives, including mine. Now let us be your light when yours feels dim. You've given so much love to the world; it's time to let love flow back to you.

This sadness is not your destination; it's just a stop along your journey. Better days are coming, and I'll be right there to celebrate them with you.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know your heart feels heavy right now, like you're carrying the weight of the world. But I want you to know that you don't have to carry it alone. I'm here to help shoulder that burden.

Your sensitivity is not a weakness - it's what makes you so special. You feel deeply because you love deeply, and that's a rare and beautiful gift in this world.

Remember all the times you've helped others through their dark moments? You have that same strength within you now. You are your own hero, and I'm your biggest cheerleader.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sadness is like a teacher that arrives uninvited but always has something important to share. It teaches us compassion, resilience, and the true value of joy when it returns.

You are not defined by your lowest moments but by how you rise from them. And you always rise, beautifully and gracefully, like the incredible person you are.

I'm here to remind you of your worth when you forget, to hold your hand when you're scared, and to celebrate with you when the sun shines again. You're never alone.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When sadness clouds your vision, remember that clouds are temporary. Behind them, the sun is always shining, just like the light within you that never truly goes out.

You have overcome so much already, and each experience has added to your wisdom and strength. This current challenge is just another chapter in your incredible story of resilience.

I love you for exactly who you are - in your joy and in your sorrow. You don't have to earn my friendship or prove your worth. You are enough, always.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I see you fighting battles that others can't see, and I want you to know how proud I am of your courage. It takes incredible strength to keep going when everything feels difficult.

Your heart is like a garden - sometimes it needs rain (even tears) to help the most beautiful flowers bloom. This sadness is watering seeds of growth you don't even know are there yet.

You are loved more than words can express. Your friendship has been one of the greatest gifts of my life, and I'll spend forever showing you how much you mean to me.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Today might feel like an ending, but I promise you it's actually a beginning. Every time we fall, we have the opportunity to rise stronger, wiser, and more compassionate than before.

You have a heart of gold and a spirit that shines even in the darkest moments. Don't let temporary sadness make you forget your permanent worth and beauty.

I'm sending you all my strength, all my hope, and all my love. You're going to get through this, and I'll be right here cheering you on every step of the way.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is simply keep breathing, keep existing, keep trying. And you're doing all of that beautifully, even when it doesn't feel like enough.

Your sadness doesn't make you a burden - it makes you human. Your struggles don't make you weak - they make you relatable and real. Your tears don't make you broken - they make you authentic.

I choose you, in your happiness and in your sadness, in your strength and in your vulnerability. You're my person, and nothing will ever change that.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want you to know that feeling sad doesn't mean you're ungrateful or weak. It means you're human, and humans feel deeply. That depth of feeling is what makes you so special and loved.

You've been my rock so many times, and now it's my turn to be yours. Lean on me, cry on my shoulder, let me carry some of your pain. That's what best friends are for.

This sadness will pass like all the others before it, but my love and friendship for you will remain constant. You're stuck with me through every season of life.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When you feel like you're drowning in sadness, remember that you're actually learning to swim in deeper waters. Each stroke makes you stronger, each breath makes you braver.

You are not your sadness, just like you are not your happiness. You are the beautiful soul experiencing all of these emotions, and that soul is precious beyond measure.

I believe in your ability to overcome this, not because you have to be strong, but because you ARE strong. It's woven into the very fabric of who you are.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Today I want to wrap you in the warmest hug and tell you that it's okay to not have it all figured out. Life is messy, feelings are complicated, and that's perfectly normal.

You bring so much light into this world, even when you can't see your own glow. Your kindness, your laughter, your caring heart - these things matter more than you know.

I'm grateful every day that I get to call you my friend. You've made my life infinitely better just by being in it. Now let me do the same for you.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sadness is not a sign that something is wrong with you - it's a sign that something matters to you. Your ability to feel deeply is one of your greatest strengths, not a weakness.

You are like a beautiful song that sometimes plays in a minor key. The minor keys don't make the song less beautiful; they make it more complex, more moving, more real.

I love every note of your song, Teju. The happy ones and the sad ones, the loud ones and the quiet ones. You are a masterpiece exactly as you are.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`

const missLetters = [
  `Dear Teju,

The distance between us feels like an ocean right now, but I want you to know that you're always close to my heart. Every sunrise reminds me of your smile, every star reminds me of the sparkle in your eyes.

Missing you isn't just about wishing you were here - it's about carrying a piece of you with me everywhere I go. Your laughter echoes in my memories, your wisdom guides my decisions, your friendship shapes who I am.

Until we meet again, know that you're thought of, missed, and loved more than words can express. Distance means nothing when someone means everything.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and I'm living proof of that truth. Every day without you makes me appreciate our friendship even more deeply.

I miss our random conversations, our inside jokes, the way you always know exactly what to say. I miss your presence, your energy, the way you make everything better just by being there.

But missing you also reminds me how lucky I am to have someone so wonderful to miss. Not everyone gets to experience a friendship as special as ours.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Right now, I'm looking at the same sky you're looking at, and somehow that makes me feel closer to you. We might be miles apart, but we're under the same stars, breathing the same air.

I miss the little things most - your texts that always come at the perfect time, your laugh that's contagious, the way you listen with your whole heart. These memories are treasures I carry with me.

Distance is temporary, but our friendship is forever. I'm counting down the days until I can hug you again and tell you in person how much you mean to me.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Missing you feels like trying to breathe with only half my lungs. You're such an essential part of my life that your absence creates a space nothing else can fill.

I find myself saving up stories to tell you, jokes to share, moments to relive together. You're woven into every part of my day, even when you're not physically here.

But this missing you also fills me with gratitude. How blessed am I to have someone who makes such a beautiful impact on my life? You're worth every moment of missing.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Today I walked past our favorite coffee shop and felt a wave of missing you wash over me. I could almost hear your laughter, almost see you sitting across from me with that bright smile.

Missing you isn't painful - it's bittersweet. It reminds me of all the beautiful memories we've created and all the ones we'll create when we're together again.

You've left footprints on my heart that distance can never erase. Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, know that you're loved and missed beyond measure.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I miss you in ways I didn't know were possible. I miss your voice, your hugs, your terrible jokes that somehow always make me laugh. I miss the comfort of knowing you're just a call away.

But missing you has also taught me something beautiful - it's shown me the depth of our connection. True friendship transcends physical distance and grows stronger with time.

You're not just missed; you're cherished, treasured, and held close in my heart every single day. Our bond is unbreakable, no matter how many miles separate us.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sometimes I catch myself reaching for my phone to text you about something silly, only to remember you're not just around the corner anymore. Those moments make my heart ache in the sweetest way.

Missing you is like missing a part of myself. You've become so integral to my happiness, my peace, my sense of home. Wherever you are feels like where I should be too.

But I know this separation is temporary. Until we're reunited, I'll carry you with me in every sunset, every song, every moment of joy. You're always with me in spirit.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

The hardest part about missing you isn't the distance - it's all the moments I want to share with you but can't. Every funny thing that happens, every beautiful sight I see, every thought I have feels incomplete without you to share it with.

You've spoiled me with your friendship, made me accustomed to having someone who truly gets me. Now everything feels a little less bright without your light beside me.

But I'm holding onto the promise of tomorrow, when distance will be just a memory and our friendship will be stronger for having survived the separation.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I miss you like the desert misses rain, like flowers miss the sun, like the ocean misses the moon. You bring life, warmth, and rhythm to my world in ways you might not even realize.

Every place we've been together holds a piece of you now. I can't walk past them without smiling, without feeling grateful for the memories we've created together.

Missing you reminds me daily of what a gift your friendship is. Not everyone is lucky enough to have someone worth missing this much. I'm one of the fortunate ones.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

They say you don't know what you have until it's gone, but I always knew how special you were. Missing you just confirms what I've always known - you're irreplaceable.

I miss your wisdom when I need advice, your humor when I need to laugh, your presence when I need comfort. You're like my personal sunshine, and everything feels a little cloudier without you.

But this missing you is also filled with anticipation. Every day apart brings us one day closer to being together again. And when that day comes, it will be pure magic.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Missing you feels like homesickness, even when I'm at home. You've become my definition of home - not a place, but a person who makes everywhere feel safe and right.

I miss our spontaneous adventures, our deep conversations, our comfortable silences. I miss the way you make ordinary moments feel extraordinary just by being part of them.

Distance might separate our bodies, but nothing can separate our hearts. You're with me in every breath, every heartbeat, every moment of every day.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I never knew it was possible to miss someone so much that it becomes a physical ache. But here I am, feeling your absence in every fiber of my being, and somehow finding beauty in it.

Missing you is proof of love. It's evidence of a connection so deep that distance becomes irrelevant. You've touched my life in ways that time and space cannot undo.

I'm not just missing you - I'm celebrating you from afar, grateful for every memory, every laugh, every moment of friendship you've given me. You're a treasure beyond measure.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Today I realized that missing you isn't about wishing you were here - it's about carrying you with me wherever I go. You've become part of my story, my identity, my heart.

I miss the way you see the world, the way you find magic in ordinary things, the way you make everyone around you feel special. Your perspective has changed mine forever.

This distance is temporary, but the impact you've had on my life is permanent. You've made me a better person, and I'll spend forever being grateful for that gift.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Missing you is like missing my favorite song - everything else sounds a little off without it. You bring harmony to my life in ways that nothing else can replicate.

I miss your spontaneous texts, your random calls, your ability to turn any day into an adventure. You have this incredible gift of making life feel more alive, more colorful, more meaningful.

But even in missing you, I feel blessed. Not everyone gets to experience a friendship so pure, so genuine, so life-changing. You're my once-in-a-lifetime friend.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

The space you've left in my daily life is shaped exactly like you - unique, irreplaceable, and impossible to fill with anything else. Missing you has taught me the true value of your presence.

I miss your contagious enthusiasm, your unwavering support, your ability to make me laugh even on my worst days. You're like sunshine personified, and everything feels dimmer without you.

But I know that true friendship transcends distance. We're connected by something stronger than proximity - we're connected by love, understanding, and an unbreakable bond.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Missing you feels like trying to paint a rainbow with only one color - possible, but never quite complete. You add all the missing hues to my life's canvas.

I miss our inside jokes that no one else understands, our shared dreams and plans, our ability to communicate without words. You're fluent in the language of my heart.

This separation is just a chapter in our story, not the ending. Our friendship is being written across time and distance, and every page is beautiful because you're in it.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I miss you in the morning when I wake up and want to share my dreams, in the afternoon when something reminds me of you, and at night when I wish you were here to say goodnight.

You've become such an integral part of my happiness that missing you feels like missing a piece of my soul. But it also reminds me how complete you make me feel when we're together.

Distance is just geography. What we have transcends space and time. You're not just missed - you're treasured, cherished, and loved beyond the boundaries of this world.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

They say the best things in life are worth waiting for, and you're definitely worth every moment of missing, every day of distance, every second of separation.

I miss your wisdom that always comes at the right time, your kindness that heals without trying, your friendship that feels like coming home. You're my safe harbor in every storm.

But missing you also fills me with hope. It reminds me that we have something so special that distance can't diminish it. Our friendship is stronger than miles, deeper than oceans.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Missing you is like missing my favorite season - everything else is beautiful, but nothing quite compares to the warmth, comfort, and joy you bring to my life.

I miss the way you listen with your whole heart, the way you celebrate my victories like they're your own, the way you believe in me even when I don't believe in myself.

This distance is temporary, but the love I have for you is eternal. You've left handprints on my heart that will never fade, no matter how far apart we are.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I miss you like the night misses the stars, like the garden misses the rain, like the heart misses its rhythm. You bring light, life, and love to everything you touch.

Every memory we've shared is a treasure I carry with me. They comfort me when I'm lonely, inspire me when I'm lost, and remind me how blessed I am to have you in my life.

Missing you isn't just about absence - it's about presence. Your presence in my life has been so profound that your absence is equally felt. You matter more than you know.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`

  `Dear Teju,

I know you're facing challenges right now, but I want you to remember something important: you are stronger than any obstacle in your path. You've overcome difficulties before, and you'll overcome this one too.

Every great achievement starts with the decision to try, and you've already made that decision by not giving up. Your determination inspires me every day, and I believe in your ability to turn this challenge into your greatest triumph.

You have everything within you to succeed. Trust yourself, trust the process, and trust that better days are coming. I'm here cheering you on every step of the way.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When the path ahead seems unclear and the mountain feels too high to climb, remember that every expert was once a beginner, every pro was once an amateur, every icon was once an unknown.

You are capable of incredible things. Your potential is limitless, your spirit is unbreakable, and your heart is full of courage. Don't let temporary setbacks make you forget your permanent worth.

The world needs what you have to offer. Your unique gifts, your perspective, your talents - they matter more than you know. Keep pushing forward, keep believing in yourself.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want to remind you of something you might have forgotten in the midst of your struggles: you are absolutely incredible. You have survived 100% of your worst days, and that's an amazing track record.

Your strength doesn't come from never falling - it comes from getting back up every time you do. And you always get back up, more resilient and wiser than before.

This challenge you're facing? It's not here to break you. It's here to reveal just how unbreakable you really are. You've got this, and I've got you.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sometimes we need to be reminded that diamonds are formed under pressure, butterflies emerge from struggle, and the most beautiful flowers bloom after the harshest winters. You are in your transformation phase.

What feels like an ending is actually a beginning. What feels like a setback is actually a setup for your comeback. What feels impossible is just waiting for you to make it I'm possible.

You have everything it takes to turn your dreams into reality. Trust the process, trust your journey, and most importantly, trust yourself. Magic is about to happen.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I see you doubting yourself, and I want to tell you something: the voice in your head that says you can't do it is a liar. You are more capable, more resilient, and more powerful than you realize.

Every time you've thought you couldn't go on, you did. Every time you've thought you weren't strong enough, you proved yourself wrong. You have a track record of overcoming, and this time will be no different.

Your dreams are not too big, you are not too small, and it is not too late. The only thing standing between you and your goals is the story you keep telling yourself about why you can't achieve them.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When you feel like giving up, remember why you started. Remember the fire in your eyes when you first dreamed this dream, the excitement in your heart when you first believed it was possible.

That fire is still there, even if it feels dim right now. Sometimes we just need to add a little fuel to make it burn bright again. Let this letter be that fuel for you today.

You are not behind in life. You are not running out of time. You are exactly where you need to be, learning exactly what you need to learn, becoming exactly who you need to become.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want you to know that it's okay to rest, but never quit. It's okay to take a break, but never give up. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, but never forget how amazing you are.

You have come so far already. Look back at where you started and see how much you've grown, how much you've learned, how much stronger you've become. That growth didn't happen by accident - it happened because of your effort and determination.

The finish line might not be visible yet, but that doesn't mean it's not there. Keep moving forward, one step at a time. You're closer than you think.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Today I want to remind you that you are not just surviving - you are thriving. Even when it doesn't feel like it, even when progress seems slow, you are moving forward and growing stronger.

Your journey is unique, and comparing it to others will only steal your joy. Focus on your own path, celebrate your own victories, and trust your own timing. You are exactly where you need to be.

The world is waiting for what you have to offer. Your talents, your ideas, your unique perspective - they are needed. Don't deprive the world of your gifts by giving up now.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know it feels like you're fighting an uphill battle, but remember that all the water in the ocean can't sink a ship unless it gets inside. Don't let doubt, fear, or negativity get inside your heart.

You are the author of your own story, and this chapter you're in right now? It's not the ending - it's the part where the hero discovers their true strength and rises to meet their destiny.

Believe in yourself as much as I believe in you. You have everything it takes to overcome this challenge and emerge victorious. Your breakthrough is coming.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When you feel like you're not making progress, remember that trees don't grow overnight, diamonds aren't formed in a day, and masterpieces aren't created in a moment. Great things take time.

You are a work of art in progress, and every challenge you face is adding depth, beauty, and strength to your character. Don't rush the process - trust it.

Your current situation is not your final destination. You are capable of creating the life you want, achieving the goals you've set, and becoming the person you're meant to be.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want you to know that feeling scared doesn't mean you're weak - it means you're about to do something really brave. Courage isn't the absence of fear; it's feeling the fear and doing it anyway.

You have been brave so many times before. Remember all the times you stepped out of your comfort zone, took risks, and tried new things. That same courage is still within you.

Don't let fear make your decisions. Don't let doubt write your story. You are the hero of your own journey, and heroes don't give up when things get tough - they get tougher.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sometimes the best thing you can do is remind yourself of how far you've already come. You are not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or even yesterday. You are constantly growing and evolving.

Every challenge you've faced has prepared you for this moment. Every lesson you've learned has equipped you with the tools you need to succeed. You are more ready than you realize.

Trust in your ability to figure things out. You always have before, and you always will. You are resourceful, intelligent, and capable of amazing things.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want to remind you that success isn't about never failing - it's about never giving up. Every successful person has a story of perseverance, of getting back up after being knocked down.

Your setbacks are not permanent, but your determination can be. Your failures are not final, but your decision to keep trying can be. Your struggles are not your identity, but your strength in overcoming them is.

You are writing a story of resilience, courage, and triumph. Don't stop writing now - the best chapters are yet to come.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When you feel like you're not good enough, remember that you don't have to be perfect to be amazing. You don't have to have it all figured out to move forward. You just have to be willing to try.

Your worth is not determined by your achievements, your failures, or other people's opinions. Your worth is inherent, unchangeable, and infinite. You matter simply because you exist.

Believe in yourself, even when others don't. Especially when others don't. Your belief in yourself is the foundation upon which all your dreams will be built.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know you're tired of fighting, tired of trying, tired of hoping. But I also know that you're stronger than your tiredness, braver than your fear, and more powerful than your circumstances.

Rest if you need to, but don't quit. Pause if you must, but don't stop. Take a breath, gather your strength, and then keep moving forward. You are so much closer to your breakthrough than you think.

The world needs your light, your gifts, your unique contribution. Don't let temporary darkness make you forget how bright you can shine.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Today I want you to remember that you are not just dreaming - you are doing. You are not just hoping - you are working. You are not just wishing - you are making it happen.

Every small step you take is progress. Every effort you make matters. Every time you choose to keep going instead of giving up, you are choosing to believe in yourself and your dreams.

Your persistence will pay off. Your hard work will be rewarded. Your dreams will come true. Keep going - you're doing better than you think.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want to remind you that you have survived every difficult day in your life so far, and you can survive whatever you're facing now. You are tougher than you think and stronger than you feel.

Your current chapter is not your whole story. This challenge is not your final destination. This struggle is not your permanent state. You are in transition, and beautiful things are coming.

Keep your head up, your heart open, and your faith strong. You are capable of incredible things, and I believe in you completely.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When you feel like giving up, remember that the darkest hour is just before dawn. When you feel like you can't go on, remember that you've felt this way before and you made it through.

You are not alone in this journey. You have people who believe in you, who are cheering you on, who want to see you succeed. I am one of those people, and I will never stop believing in you.

Your dreams are valid, your goals are achievable, and your success is inevitable if you don't give up. Keep pushing forward - your breakthrough is coming.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want you to know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. It's okay to feel like you don't know what you're doing. It's okay to feel scared about the future. These feelings don't make you weak - they make you human.

But don't let these feelings stop you from moving forward. Use them as fuel for your determination. Let them remind you that what you're doing matters, that your dreams are worth fighting for.

You have everything within you to succeed. Trust yourself, trust the process, and trust that everything is working out for your highest good.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Today I want to remind you that you are not behind in life. You are not running out of time. You are not too old, too young, too late, or too anything. You are exactly where you need to be.

Your journey is unique, and it's unfolding at exactly the right pace. Don't let anyone else's timeline make you feel like you're not doing enough. You are doing your best, and that is enough.

Keep believing in yourself, keep working toward your goals, and keep trusting that everything will work out. You are on the right path, even when it doesn't feel like it.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`

  `Dear Teju,

I know your mind is racing tonight, filled with thoughts that won't quiet down. Sometimes our brains forget that nighttime is for rest, not for solving all the world's problems.

Take a deep breath with me. In... and out. Feel your body sinking into your bed, feel the weight of the day lifting from your shoulders. You are safe, you are loved, and you can let go now.

Tomorrow's worries can wait until tomorrow. Tonight is for peace, for rest, for letting your beautiful mind finally be still. Close your eyes and drift into dreams as wonderful as you are.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

The stars are shining just for you tonight, and the moon is keeping watch while you sleep. You don't have to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders - you can set it down now.

Let your thoughts float away like clouds in the night sky. Let your worries dissolve like sugar in warm milk. Let your mind become as quiet as a still lake under moonlight.

You deserve peaceful sleep, sweet dreams, and a tomorrow that's brighter than today. Rest now, knowing that you are cherished beyond measure.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I wish I could be there to make you a cup of chamomile tea and sit with you until you feel sleepy. Since I can't, I'm sending you all my love and the most peaceful energy I can muster.

Remember that sleep is not a luxury - it's a necessity. Your body needs rest to heal, your mind needs quiet to process, and your soul needs stillness to recharge.

Let go of today's stress, tomorrow's uncertainties, and everything in between. Right now, in this moment, you are exactly where you need to be. Sleep well, beautiful soul.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sometimes our minds are like busy cities that never sleep, but tonight I want you to imagine yourself in a peaceful meadow under a blanket of stars. Feel the soft grass beneath you, hear the gentle whisper of the wind.

You don't have to solve everything tonight. You don't have to figure out all the answers. You just have to breathe, relax, and trust that everything will work out as it should.

Close your eyes and let sleep wrap around you like the warmest, softest blanket. You are safe, you are loved, and you are exactly where you belong.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know your thoughts are spinning like a carousel that won't stop, but I want you to know that it's okay to step off the ride. It's okay to tell your mind that it's time to rest.

Think of all the people who love you, including me, sending you peaceful thoughts right now. Feel that love surrounding you like a protective bubble of calm and serenity.

Your body has worked hard today, your mind has processed so much, and now it's time to reward them both with the gift of rest. Sweet dreams, my dear friend.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Tonight, I want you to imagine that I'm there with you, sitting by your bedside, gently stroking your hair and humming a lullaby. Feel the comfort of knowing you're not alone, even in the quiet of the night.

Let your breathing slow down, let your muscles relax, let your mind release all the tension it's been holding. You've done enough for today - more than enough.

Sleep is your sanctuary, your refuge, your time to heal and restore. Embrace it like an old friend who's come to comfort you. Rest well, beautiful.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know it's hard to quiet your mind when it feels like there's so much to think about, so much to worry about, so much to plan. But right now, none of that matters. Right now, only rest matters.

Imagine all your worries as balloons that you're releasing into the night sky. Watch them float away, getting smaller and smaller until they disappear completely.

You are safe in this moment. You are loved in this moment. You are exactly where you need to be in this moment. Let that knowledge carry you into peaceful sleep.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

The night is a gentle friend who comes to wrap you in darkness so you can rest. Don't fight it - welcome it. Let it soothe your tired eyes and calm your restless mind.

Think of sleep as a gift you give yourself - the gift of restoration, of peace, of letting go. You deserve this gift every single night, especially tonight.

Close your eyes and listen to the rhythm of your own heartbeat. Let it be your lullaby, steady and comforting, reminding you that you are alive, you are loved, and you are at peace.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sometimes the hardest part about falling asleep is giving ourselves permission to stop thinking, stop worrying, stop trying to control everything. Tonight, I'm giving you that permission.

You don't have to be strong right now. You don't have to have all the answers. You don't have to fix anything. You just have to be, and that is enough.

Let sleep be your escape, your retreat, your time to recharge for tomorrow's adventures. You've earned this rest, and you deserve every moment of peace it brings.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want you to know that it's okay if sleep doesn't come immediately. Sometimes we have to court it gently, like a shy friend who needs coaxing. Be patient with yourself.

Focus on the feeling of your body against the mattress, the softness of your pillow, the warmth of your blankets. Let these physical comforts anchor you in the present moment.

You are not alone in your sleeplessness. I'm here with you in spirit, sending you all the peaceful energy I can. Rest will come when it's ready, and so will you.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Tonight, let's practice the art of letting go together. Let go of today's mistakes, tomorrow's worries, and everything that's making your mind race. You can pick them up tomorrow if you really need to.

Imagine your bed as a cloud floating in a peaceful sky. Feel yourself sinking into its softness, supported and safe. Let it carry you away from all your earthly concerns.

Sleep is not giving up - it's giving in to what your body and mind need most. Trust in the wisdom of rest, and let it work its magic on your weary soul.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know your mind is like a browser with too many tabs open, but tonight I want you to close them all except one - the tab that says "rest and peace." Focus only on that.

Feel your body melting into your bed like warm honey, sweet and golden and perfectly at ease. Let every muscle relax, every tension dissolve, every worry fade away.

You are held by love, surrounded by peace, and deserving of the deepest, most restorative sleep. Trust in the night to take care of you while you rest.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sometimes we resist sleep because we're afraid of losing control, afraid of missing something, afraid of being vulnerable. But sleep is not surrender - it's self-care in its purest form.

Tonight, I want you to think of sleep as a loving friend who comes to take away your burdens for a few hours. Let this friend do their job. Let them care for you.

You don't have to earn rest - you deserve it simply by being human. Close your eyes and accept this gift that your body is trying to give you.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

The world will keep spinning while you sleep. The problems will still be there tomorrow, but so will your strength to face them. Right now, your only job is to rest.

Imagine that I'm singing you a lullaby, soft and gentle and full of love. Let the melody carry away all your stress, all your anxiety, all your restless thoughts.

You are precious, you are loved, and you deserve peaceful sleep. Let that truth settle into your heart and carry you into the sweetest of dreams.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know it feels like your mind has forgotten how to be quiet, but I promise it remembers. Sometimes we just need to remind it gently, patiently, lovingly.

Think of three things you're grateful for today. Let that gratitude fill your heart with warmth and contentment. Let it be the last thing on your mind as you drift off to sleep.

You've done your best today, and that is enough. You are enough. Now rest, knowing that tomorrow is a new day full of new possibilities.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Tonight, I want you to imagine that all your loved ones, including me, are forming a circle of protection around you as you sleep. Feel our love surrounding you like the softest blanket.

Let your breathing become slow and deep, like gentle waves on a calm shore. In and out, in and out, each breath taking you deeper into relaxation.

Sleep is your sanctuary, your safe space, your time to heal and restore. Embrace it fully, knowing that you are loved, protected, and cherished always.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I wish I could bottle up all the peace in the world and give it to you right now. Since I can't, I'm sending you all the calm, soothing energy in my heart.

Remember that you don't have to solve everything tonight. You don't have to be perfect, productive, or anything other than exactly who you are in this moment.

Close your eyes and let sleep be your teacher tonight. Let it teach you the art of letting go, the beauty of surrender, the peace that comes with trust.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sometimes the night feels long and lonely, but I want you to know that you're never truly alone. Love transcends distance, and my love for you is with you always, especially now.

Let your pillow cradle your head like the gentlest hands, let your blankets embrace you like the warmest hug, let your bed be your refuge from the world.

You are safe, you are loved, and you are exactly where you need to be. Let that knowledge be your lullaby as you drift into peaceful, restorative sleep.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Tonight, I want you to give yourself the same compassion you would give a dear friend who couldn't sleep. Be gentle with yourself, be patient, be kind.

Think of sleep as a gift you're giving to tomorrow's version of yourself - the gift of energy, clarity, and renewed strength. You deserve to wake up feeling refreshed and ready.

Close your eyes and trust in the wisdom of your body. It knows how to heal, how to rest, how to restore itself. All you have to do is let it do its beautiful work.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

As you lie there in the quiet darkness, know that somewhere in the world, I'm thinking of you with nothing but love and hope for your peaceful rest.

Let go of the need to control your thoughts. Let them come and go like clouds in the sky - acknowledge them, then let them drift away. You are not your thoughts; you are the peaceful observer.

Sleep well, my dear friend. May your dreams be sweet, your rest be deep, and your tomorrow be bright. You are loved beyond measure.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`

const laughLetters = [
  `Dear Teju,

I hope this letter finds you ready to smile because I'm about to remind you of some of the ridiculous things we've laughed about together! Remember when you tried to be all sophisticated and ordered that fancy coffee, then made the most hilarious face when you tasted it?

Or how about the time you were so confident you knew the way, and we ended up completely lost but had the best adventure because of it? You turned getting lost into the most fun part of our day!

Life is so much better with laughter, and you have this amazing gift of finding humor in the most unexpected places. Never lose that beautiful ability to laugh, especially at yourself!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I was just thinking about all the times you've made me laugh until my stomach hurt, and I realized you're basically a walking comedy show! Remember your impression of that overly dramatic movie character? I'm still laughing about it!

You have this incredible talent for turning ordinary moments into hilarious memories. Like when you tried to be graceful and ended up in the most ungraceful but absolutely adorable situation ever!

The world needs more people like you - people who can find joy in the silly things, who aren't afraid to be goofy, who can make others smile just by being themselves. You're a natural comedian!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Quick question: Do you remember when you were trying to be all cool and mysterious, but then you tripped over absolutely nothing and played it off like it was intentional? Because I do, and I'm still giggling about it!

You have this amazing ability to laugh at yourself, and that's one of the things I love most about you. You don't take yourself too seriously, and that makes you absolutely delightful to be around.

I hope you're laughing right now, maybe even snorting a little (you know you do that when something is really funny). Your laugh is contagious, and the world is brighter because of it!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I have a confession: sometimes when I'm having a bad day, I just think about your ridiculous dance moves, and instantly everything feels better! You dance like nobody's watching, even when everybody is!

Remember when you were singing in the car and got so into it that you didn't notice the person in the next car watching you? Your complete lack of embarrassment was absolutely hilarious and inspiring!

You remind me that life is too short to be serious all the time. Sometimes we need to dance badly, sing loudly, and laugh until we can't breathe. You're the perfect reminder of that!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I was just remembering the time you tried to tell that joke but kept forgetting the punchline, and somehow your confusion was funnier than the actual joke would have been! You're accidentally hilarious, and it's the best thing ever.

You have this wonderful way of finding humor in your own mistakes. Instead of getting embarrassed, you laugh along, and that makes everyone else feel comfortable being imperfect too.

Your ability to laugh at life's little mishaps is a superpower. You turn awkward moments into funny stories, and that's a gift not everyone has. Keep being wonderfully, hilariously you!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Do you know what makes you absolutely hilarious? The way you tell stories! You get so animated and dramatic, using your whole body to act out every detail. Watching you tell a story is better than watching a movie!

I love how you can take the most mundane experience - like going to the grocery store - and turn it into an epic adventure tale complete with villains (the person with too many items in the express lane) and heroes (the kind cashier).

Your storytelling skills combined with your natural humor make you the most entertaining person I know. Never stop turning life into a comedy show!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I hope you're ready for this because I'm about to remind you of the time you were trying to be sophisticated at that fancy restaurant, and you couldn't figure out which fork to use, so you just stared at them like they were going to give you a sign!

The best part wasn't your confusion - it was how you handled it! You just shrugged and said, "When in doubt, use the biggest one!" and proceeded to eat your salad with a dinner fork like it was the most normal thing in the world.

Your ability to roll with life's little confusions and turn them into funny moments is one of your greatest talents. You make awkward situations feel comfortable and hilarious!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I'm sitting here thinking about your unique relationship with technology, and I can't stop laughing! Remember when you were convinced your phone was broken because it wasn't responding, and it turned out you were touching the screen with gloves on?

Or the time you spent twenty minutes looking for your glasses while they were on your head? The look of realization on your face when you finally found them was priceless!

These moments aren't embarrassing - they're endearing and hilarious! You prove that being perfectly put-together is overrated. Your adorable absent-mindedness makes life so much more fun!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I have to share this because it still makes me laugh: remember when you were trying to impress someone with your cooking skills, and you confidently declared you were making a "gourmet meal," then proceeded to burn water? HOW DO YOU BURN WATER?!

But the best part was your reaction! Instead of being mortified, you just looked at the pot and said, "Well, that's one way to add flavor!" Your ability to find humor in your own disasters is absolutely amazing.

You turn kitchen catastrophes into comedy gold, and honestly, your cooking adventures are more entertaining than any TV show. Never change, you beautiful disaster!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I was just thinking about your ongoing battle with autocorrect, and I'm dying laughing all over again! The messages you've sent me that were supposed to say one thing but said something completely ridiculous instead are comedy gold!

My favorite was when you meant to text "I'm running late" but autocorrect changed it to "I'm running with late," and then you spent five minutes trying to explain who Late was and why you were running with them!

Your relationship with technology is like a comedy show that never ends. You and your phone should have your own sitcom! Keep fighting the good fight against autocorrect - you're winning in the humor department!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Can we talk about your unique approach to directions? You have this amazing ability to get lost in places you've been a hundred times! Remember when you got confused in your own neighborhood and called me for help?

The best part is how you describe where you are: "I'm near the tree... you know, the big one... by the thing..." Your landmark descriptions are works of art! Who needs street names when you have "the place with the red door next to the thing"?

Your creative navigation skills have led us on some of the best unplanned adventures. Getting lost with you is more fun than arriving on time with anyone else!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I'm still laughing about the time you tried to be all mysterious and cool by wearing sunglasses indoors, then proceeded to walk into a glass door because you couldn't see properly! The confidence with which you walked into that door was truly impressive!

And instead of being embarrassed, you just adjusted your sunglasses and said, "I meant to do that. I was testing the door's durability." Your ability to play off awkward moments with humor is unmatched!

You prove that confidence isn't about being perfect - it's about owning your imperfections and making them hilarious. You're the queen of turning embarrassing moments into entertaining stories!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I have to remind you of your epic battle with that automatic door that wouldn't open for you. You stood there waving your arms like you were conducting an orchestra, trying to trigger the sensor!

The funniest part was when you started talking to the door: "Come on, door, I know you can see me! I'm right here! Don't ignore me!" And then when it finally opened, you said "Thank you" like it was a person!

Your ability to have full conversations with inanimate objects is both hilarious and oddly charming. You bring personality to everything, even stubborn doors!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Remember when you decided to try that new exercise video and were so confident you could keep up? Five minutes in, you were lying on the floor declaring that the instructor was "clearly not human" and that exercise was "a conspiracy against comfortable people"!

Your commentary during that workout was better than any comedy special! "Why is she still smiling? Make her stop smiling! No one should be that happy while doing burpees!"

You turned a workout into a comedy show, and honestly, I burned more calories laughing at your commentary than I would have doing the actual exercises. You're a fitness comedian!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I'm still giggling about your attempt to be a "morning person." You set seventeen alarms, bought a fancy coffee maker, and declared you were going to "seize the day!" Then you snoozed every alarm and showed up looking like you'd been wrestling with your pillow all night!

Your definition of "seizing the day" turned out to be "seizing five more minutes of sleep" repeatedly. And when you finally got up, your hair looked like you'd been electrocuted, but you just shrugged and said, "This is my natural style!"

Your relationship with mornings is a beautiful disaster, and I love how you've just accepted that you're not built for sunrise productivity. You're perfect exactly as you are - a delightful night owl!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Can we please discuss your unique approach to assembling furniture? You looked at those instructions like they were written in ancient hieroglyphics, then confidently declared, "Instructions are just suggestions!"

Three hours later, you had created something that vaguely resembled furniture but definitely wasn't what was pictured on the box. When I asked what it was, you proudly announced, "It's abstract furniture! It's art!"

Your creative interpretation of furniture assembly is legendary. Who needs a bookshelf when you can have a "multi-level decorative storage sculpture"? You're an artist, not a furniture assembler!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I'm dying laughing thinking about your cooking experiment phase. Remember when you decided to "improvise" that recipe and substituted salt for sugar because "they're both white crystals"?

The look on your face when you tasted that "sweet" pasta sauce was absolutely priceless! And instead of admitting defeat, you tried to convince me it was "avant-garde cuisine" and that I just didn't understand your "culinary vision"!

Your confidence in your cooking disasters is both hilarious and admirable. You turn kitchen failures into gourmet adventures, and honestly, your creativity knows no bounds!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Remember when you tried to be all graceful and sophisticated at that fancy event, but then you got your heel stuck in a grate and had to be rescued by three people? The way you played it off was amazing!

You just smiled and said, "I was just testing the structural integrity of the sidewalk. It passed!" Your ability to turn embarrassing moments into confident declarations is a true talent!

You prove that grace isn't about never falling - it's about how you handle yourself when you do. And you handle yourself with humor, confidence, and style. You're perfectly imperfect!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I have to share this because it still makes me laugh until I cry: remember when you were trying to take a serious, sophisticated selfie, but you accidentally had the camera on video mode and recorded yourself making faces for two minutes straight?

The best part was when you realized what happened and just shrugged and said, "Well, at least now I have a documentary of my thought process!" Your ability to find the positive in any situation is hilarious and inspiring!

You turn accidental moments into intentional comedy, and that's a gift. Your blooper reels are better than most people's highlight reels!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I hope this letter has you laughing, snorting, and maybe even crying a little from all the giggles! You have this incredible gift of bringing joy and laughter wherever you go, and the world is so much brighter because of it.

Never stop being your wonderfully ridiculous, accidentally hilarious, perfectly imperfect self. Your ability to laugh at life and make others laugh along with you is pure magic.

Keep being the comedy queen you are, and remember - life's too short to be serious all the time. Keep dancing badly, singing loudly, and laughing until your stomach hurts!

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`

  `Dear Teju,

I can feel the weight of stress on your shoulders from here, and I want you to know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. You're carrying so much, and you're doing it with such grace, even when you don't feel graceful.

Take a deep breath with me right now. In through your nose... hold it... and out through your mouth. Feel your shoulders drop, feel the tension release, even if just for a moment.

You don't have to have everything figured out right now. You don't have to be perfect. You just have to be you, and that is more than enough. I believe in your ability to handle whatever comes your way.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know your mind feels like a browser with a hundred tabs open, all demanding attention at once. But right now, I want you to close all those tabs except one - the one that says "I am enough, and I will get through this."

Stress is not a reflection of your inability to cope - it's a sign that you care deeply about the things in your life. Your stress comes from love, from responsibility, from wanting to do well. That's beautiful, even when it's overwhelming.

Remember that you've handled 100% of your stressful days so far. You have a perfect track record of getting through difficult times. This time will be no different.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When stress feels like a storm raging inside you, remember that you are not the storm - you are the calm center within it. You have the power to find peace even in the midst of chaos.

It's okay to say no to things that add unnecessary stress to your life. It's okay to ask for help. It's okay to take breaks. Taking care of yourself isn't selfish - it's necessary.

You are stronger than your stress, braver than your anxiety, and more capable than your doubts. This difficult time is temporary, but your resilience is permanent.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want you to imagine that I'm there with you right now, making you a cup of your favorite tea and sitting beside you in comfortable silence. Feel the warmth of the cup in your hands, the steam rising gently, the first soothing sip.

Stress has a way of making everything feel urgent, but most things can wait. Your health, your peace of mind, your well-being - these cannot wait. They must come first.

Give yourself permission to pause, to breathe, to step back from the chaos. You don't have to solve everything today. You just have to take care of yourself today.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know you feel like you're juggling a thousand things and afraid to drop any of them. But here's a secret: some of those things are made of rubber and will bounce back if you drop them. Focus on the glass ones - the truly important things.

Your worth is not determined by how much you can handle or how perfectly you can manage everything. Your worth is inherent, unchangeable, and has nothing to do with your productivity or performance.

Be gentle with yourself today. Treat yourself with the same kindness you would show a dear friend who was struggling. You deserve that compassion, especially from yourself.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Stress is like a rocking chair - it gives you something to do but doesn't get you anywhere. Right now, I want you to step off that rocking chair and plant your feet firmly on solid ground.

What's one small thing you can do right now to feel a little better? Maybe it's taking five deep breaths, maybe it's stepping outside for fresh air, maybe it's just acknowledging that you're doing your best.

You don't have to climb the whole mountain today. You just have to take the next step. And then the next one. One step at a time, you'll reach the top.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want to remind you that it's okay to feel stressed, but don't let stress define you. You are not your to-do list, you are not your deadlines, you are not your obligations. You are a beautiful human being deserving of peace and joy.

Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is rest. Sometimes the most important task is taking care of yourself. Sometimes the best solution is to stop trying to solve everything.

Trust that everything will work out as it should. Trust in your ability to handle whatever comes. Trust that this stressful period is temporary and that calmer days are ahead.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When stress makes you feel like you're drowning, remember that you know how to swim. You've navigated difficult waters before, and you have all the skills you need to navigate them again.

It's okay to float for a while instead of swimming hard against the current. Sometimes the best strategy is to conserve your energy and let the current carry you to calmer waters.

You are not alone in this. I'm here with you, cheering you on, believing in you, ready to throw you a life preserver if you need one. But I know you're strong enough to make it to shore.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know everything feels urgent right now, but I want you to remember that very few things are actually emergencies. Most of what's stressing you can wait a few hours, or even a few days, without the world ending.

Take a moment to prioritize. What absolutely must be done today? What can wait until tomorrow? What can you delegate or eliminate entirely? You have more control than stress wants you to believe.

Your peace of mind is worth more than any deadline, any expectation, any pressure from others. Protect it fiercely, because when you're at peace, everything else becomes manageable.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Stress is often just excitement without breath. So let's add some breath back into your life. Breathe in calm, breathe out tension. Breathe in strength, breathe out worry. Breathe in love, breathe out fear.

You are more resilient than you know, more capable than you feel, and stronger than your current circumstances. This stress is not permanent, but your ability to overcome it is.

Remember that asking for help is not a sign of weakness - it's a sign of wisdom. You don't have to carry everything alone. Let others help you bear the load.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want you to know that it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed sometimes. You're not failing, you're not weak, you're not inadequate. You're human, and humans have limits.

Think of stress as a signal from your body and mind that you need to slow down, reassess, and take better care of yourself. It's not punishment - it's protection.

You've overcome challenges before that seemed impossible at the time. You have a track record of resilience, of finding solutions, of making it through. Trust in that history of strength.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When stress makes everything feel like a crisis, try to zoom out and see the bigger picture. In five years, will this matter? In one year? Sometimes even in one week, today's stress becomes tomorrow's forgotten worry.

You are not behind in life. You are not running out of time. You are exactly where you need to be, learning exactly what you need to learn, growing in exactly the ways you need to grow.

Be patient with yourself as you navigate this stressful time. Growth is uncomfortable, change is challenging, and progress is rarely linear. You're doing better than you think.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know you feel like you have to be strong for everyone else, but you don't have to be strong for me. With me, you can be tired, overwhelmed, stressed, and human. You can let your guard down.

Stress often comes from trying to control things that are beyond our control. Focus your energy on what you can influence and let go of what you cannot. This shift in focus can bring immediate relief.

Remember that self-care isn't selfish - it's essential. You can't pour from an empty cup. Take time to refill yours, even if it's just five minutes of quiet breathing.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want to remind you that you don't have to earn your worth through stress and struggle. You don't have to prove your value by taking on more than you can handle. You are valuable simply because you exist.

Sometimes the most courageous thing you can do is rest. Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is nothing. Sometimes the most important decision you can make is to be kind to yourself.

This stressful period is a chapter in your story, not the whole book. Better chapters are coming, filled with peace, joy, and the satisfaction of having overcome this challenge.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When stress makes you feel like you're in a maze with no exit, remember that every maze has a solution. Sometimes you have to backtrack, sometimes you have to try a different path, but there is always a way out.

You don't have to see the whole staircase to take the first step. You don't have to have all the answers to move forward. You just have to trust that each step will reveal the next one.

I believe in your ability to find your way through this stressful time. You have wisdom, strength, and resilience that you haven't even tapped into yet. You've got this.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Stress has a way of making molehills look like mountains. Step back and try to see things as they really are, not as stress makes them appear. Most of what we worry about never actually happens.

You are not your stress. You are the person experiencing stress, but it does not define you. You are still kind, still capable, still worthy of love and respect, regardless of how overwhelmed you feel.

Take things one moment at a time. This moment, right now, you are okay. You are breathing, you are alive, you are loved. Let that be enough for now.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I know you're tired of being strong, tired of holding it all together, tired of pretending everything is fine. It's okay to not be okay. It's okay to admit you're struggling.

Stress is not a character flaw - it's a human experience. Everyone feels overwhelmed sometimes. You're not alone in this, and you don't have to face it alone.

Remember that this too shall pass. The stress you're feeling today will not last forever. You will find your way through this, and you'll be stronger and wiser because of it.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When stress makes you feel like you're running on empty, remember that it's okay to pull over and refuel. You don't have to keep going until you break down.

Your mental health is just as important as your physical health. You wouldn't ignore a broken leg, so don't ignore a stressed mind. Take care of both with equal attention and compassion.

I'm here to remind you that you are loved, you are supported, and you are not alone. Whatever you're facing, we'll face it together. You don't have to carry this burden by yourself.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Stress often whispers lies: "You're not good enough," "You can't handle this," "Everyone else has it figured out." Don't listen to those lies. Listen to the truth: You are capable, you are strong, you are enough.

Take a moment to celebrate how far you've come. Look at all the challenges you've already overcome, all the growth you've experienced, all the strength you've discovered within yourself.

You are not just surviving this stressful time - you are learning, growing, and becoming more resilient. This experience is adding to your wisdom and strength, even when it doesn't feel like it.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want to end this letter by reminding you that stress is temporary, but your strength is permanent. This difficult time will pass, but the resilience you're building will last forever.

Be gentle with yourself as you navigate these choppy waters. You're doing the best you can with what you have, and that is always enough. You are enough, exactly as you are.

Take a deep breath, let your shoulders relax, and know that tomorrow is a new day with new possibilities. You've got this, and I've got you. Always.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`

  `Dear Teju,

I need you to stop whatever you're doing right now and really hear this: You are loved. Not because of what you do, not because of what you achieve, not because of how you look or how perfect you are. You are loved simply because you exist.

Your heart, with all its kindness and compassion, makes this world a better place. Your smile lights up rooms and lifts spirits. Your friendship is a treasure that I cherish every single day.

When you doubt your worth, remember this letter. Remember that there are people in this world - including me - whose lives are infinitely better because you're in them. You matter more than you know.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sometimes I think you forget how absolutely incredible you are, so I'm here to remind you. You have this amazing ability to make everyone around you feel seen, heard, and valued. That's not a small gift - that's a superpower.

The way you listen with your whole heart, the way you remember little details about people's lives, the way you show up for others even when you're struggling yourself - these things make you extraordinary.

You are not just loved - you are cherished, treasured, and appreciated beyond measure. Your presence in this world is a gift that keeps on giving.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want you to know that you are loved on your good days and your bad days, when you're confident and when you're insecure, when you're strong and when you're vulnerable. Your worth doesn't fluctuate with your mood or circumstances.

You bring so much joy, laughter, and light into the lives of everyone who knows you. Your friendship has been one of the greatest blessings of my life, and I never take it for granted.

On days when you feel unlovable, remember this: You are loved fiercely, completely, and unconditionally. Nothing you do or don't do could ever change that.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Do you know what makes you so easy to love? It's your authenticity. You don't pretend to be perfect, you don't hide your flaws, you don't put on a mask. You're genuinely, beautifully, perfectly you.

Your vulnerability is not weakness - it's courage. Your sensitivity is not a flaw - it's a gift. Your caring heart is not too much - it's exactly what this world needs more of.

You are loved for your quirks, your imperfections, your unique way of seeing the world. You are loved for being exactly who you are, not who you think you should be.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I need you to understand something important: You don't have to earn love. You don't have to be perfect to deserve it. You don't have to prove your worth to receive it. Love is not something you earn - it's something you are worthy of simply by existing.

Your kindness, your generosity, your beautiful spirit - these are not requirements for love, they are expressions of the love that already exists within you and around you.

You are loved not for what you do, but for who you are. And who you are is absolutely wonderful.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sometimes love feels abstract, so let me make it concrete for you: You are loved when you wake up in the morning and when you go to sleep at night. You are loved when you're laughing and when you're crying. You are loved when you succeed and when you fail.

You are loved in your silence and in your chatter, in your confidence and in your doubt, in your strength and in your weakness. There is no version of you that is not worthy of love.

I love your terrible jokes, your random thoughts, your way of getting excited about small things. I love how you care so deeply about others, how you see beauty in ordinary moments, how you make everything more fun just by being there.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

You have this incredible ability to love others so well, but I wonder if you love yourself with the same kindness. You deserve to be loved by yourself as much as you are loved by others.

Look in the mirror and see what I see: someone beautiful, inside and out. Someone worthy of every good thing life has to offer. Someone who makes the world brighter just by being in it.

You are not too much, you are not too little, you are not too anything. You are exactly enough, exactly as you are. You are loved completely and unconditionally.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want to tell you about the love that surrounds you, even when you can't feel it. It's in the sunrise that greets you each morning, in the stars that watch over you each night, in the air that sustains you with every breath.

It's in the friends who think of you when you're not around, in the family who carries you in their hearts, in the strangers whose lives you've touched without even knowing it.

Love is not just an emotion - it's the fabric of your existence. You are woven from love, surrounded by love, and destined for love. You cannot escape it because you are it.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When you feel forgotten or overlooked, remember this: You are thought of more often than you know. You are missed when you're not around. You are appreciated for things you don't even realize you do.

Your impact on others is far greater than you imagine. The kindness you show, the love you give, the light you shine - these things ripple out into the world in ways you'll never fully see.

You matter to so many people, in so many ways. Your existence makes a difference. You are loved not just by a few, but by many, and that love is real and lasting.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I love how you get excited about little things - a good song, a beautiful sunset, a funny meme. Your enthusiasm for life's simple pleasures is contagious and reminds me to find joy in ordinary moments.

I love how you remember birthdays, how you check in on people, how you celebrate others' successes as if they were your own. Your heart is so full of love for others, and that love comes back to you multiplied.

You are loved for your big heart, your generous spirit, and your ability to make everyone feel special. You are a gift to this world, and I'm grateful every day that I get to know you.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Love isn't always loud or dramatic. Sometimes it's quiet and steady, like the way I think of you when I see something that would make you laugh, or the way I save stories to tell you later.

Love is in the way I worry about you when you're going through a tough time, the way I celebrate your victories as if they were my own, the way I believe in you even when you don't believe in yourself.

You are loved in a thousand small ways every single day. That love is constant, unwavering, and unconditional. It's not going anywhere, and neither am I.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want you to know that you are loved not despite your imperfections, but including them. Your flaws don't make you less lovable - they make you human, relatable, and real.

Your struggles don't diminish your worth. Your mistakes don't define your value. Your bad days don't erase your goodness. You are loved in your entirety, not just the parts you think are worthy.

You are a complete package of wonderful and imperfect, strong and vulnerable, confident and uncertain. And every single part of that package is loved completely.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Sometimes we think love has to be earned through achievement, beauty, or perfection. But the deepest, truest love is unconditional. It exists not because of what you do, but because of who you are.

You are loved for your essence, your spirit, your unique way of being in this world. You are loved for the way you make others feel, for the light you bring to dark places, for the hope you inspire in hopeless moments.

This love is not fragile or conditional. It's strong, steady, and permanent. It will be there tomorrow, next year, and always. You can count on it like you count on the sun rising.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I love watching you discover your own strength, seeing you realize your own worth, witnessing you become more and more yourself with each passing day. Your growth is beautiful to behold.

You are loved not just for who you are now, but for who you're becoming. Every step of your journey, every lesson you learn, every way you grow - it's all part of the beautiful story of you.

Your potential is limitless, your future is bright, and your worth is infinite. You are loved not just in this moment, but in every moment that's coming. You are loved into your future.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

When the world feels cold or cruel, remember that you are surrounded by warmth and kindness. When people seem distant or uncaring, remember that you are cherished and valued.

You have created a circle of love around yourself through your kindness, your authenticity, and your generous heart. That circle protects you, supports you, and celebrates you.

You are not alone, you are not unloved, you are not forgotten. You are held in the hearts of many, thought of with fondness, and cherished beyond measure.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want to end this letter with a promise: No matter what happens, no matter where life takes you, no matter how much time passes, you will always be loved. This love is not dependent on circumstances - it's woven into the very fabric of who you are.

You are loved when you're happy and when you're sad, when you're successful and when you're struggling, when you're confident and when you're uncertain. This love is constant, like the North Star.

Carry this knowledge with you always: You are deeply, truly, completely loved. Not because you have to be, not because you've earned it, but because you are you. And you are absolutely wonderful.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

Love is not just a feeling - it's a recognition of worth, a celebration of existence, an acknowledgment of beauty. And when I look at you, I see someone worthy of all the love this world has to offer.

You are loved for your laughter that brightens rooms, for your tears that show your compassion, for your dreams that inspire others to dream bigger. You are loved for your whole, complete, beautiful self.

Never doubt this love. Never question your worthiness of it. Never think you have to change to deserve it. You are loved exactly as you are, right now, in this moment and always.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I hope this letter finds you feeling the love that surrounds you, but if it doesn't, I hope it reminds you that love is always there, even when you can't feel it. Like the sun behind clouds, it's always shining.

You are a beloved child of the universe, a treasured friend, a cherished soul. Your existence is a gift, your presence is a blessing, and your love is a miracle that makes everything better.

Remember this always: You are loved beyond measure, beyond words, beyond anything you could ever imagine. You are loved with a love that is infinite, eternal, and unshakeable.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

As I finish this letter, I want you to close your eyes and feel the love that surrounds you. Feel it in the air you breathe, in the ground beneath your feet, in the sky above your head.

Feel it in every heartbeat, every breath, every moment of your existence. You are not just loved - you are love itself, expressing itself in the beautiful, unique form that is you.

You are loved, you are love, and you are absolutely, completely, perfectly wonderful. Never forget that, not even for a moment.

Your World Best Friend,
Kartik`,

  `Dear Teju,

I want to leave you with this truth: In a world of billions of people, there is only one you. You are irreplaceable, incomparable, and absolutely essential to the tapestry of existence.

You are loved not because you're like everyone else, but because you're like no one else. Your uniqueness is not a flaw to be fixed - it's a gift to be celebrated.

You are loved, you are special, you are important, and you are absolutely perfect exactly as you are. Hold onto that truth, especially on the days when you forget it.

Your World Best Friend,
